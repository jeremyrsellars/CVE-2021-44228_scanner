# findclassfiles

A Clojure library designed to find JndiLookup.class in nearly any directory or zip, jar, ear, war file, even deeply nested.  This lets you see if the log4j files might be vulerable to CVE-2021-44228, etc..

## Scripts

* findJndiLookup.cmd – Runs the program for all local disks, printing progress to the console and showing results in notepad when it's all done.
* findJndiLookup.ps1 – Runs the program for all local disks, printing progress to stderr and results to stdout.

## Usage

```powershell
    $Env:parallel = "true"
    java -jar target\findclassfiles-standalone.jar (([System.String]::Join("\ ", (get-wmiobject -class win32_logicaldisk -filter "DriveType =3" |select-object -ExpandProperty DeviceId))+"\").Split(" "))
```
