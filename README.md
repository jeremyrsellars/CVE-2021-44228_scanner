# File system scanner for CVE-2021-44228

Aims to find JndiLookup.class in nearly any directory or zip, jar, ear, war file, even deeply nested.

* [find-class-files](./find-class-files) – Clojure implementation should be able to run nearly anywhere Java can run, assuming there's enough disk space.
   * Given a set of file system roots (c:\my_dir or /home/home/on/the/range), shows instances of JndiLookup.class on the disk or in zips.
* [windows_cmd](./windows_cmd) – Prototype Windows scripts are batch files, but they're really slow and can get pretty verbose and they can't tell you the file hash.
